## üì¶ Installation & Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
- A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- (Optional but recommended for development) A local web server to handle asset paths correctly (e.g., Live Server VS Code extension, Python's `http.server`).

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.)

2.  **Get an API Key:**

    - Go to [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and sign up for a free API key.
    - Open `js/app.js` and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key:

      ```javascript
      const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; // <-- Replace this with your key
      ```

3.  **Open the project:**
    - Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    - **Recommended:** Use a local development server (e.g., VS Code's Live Server extension) to run the project. This ensures proper loading of all assets and correct API requests.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **API Key Security:** For a production application, directly embedding your API key in client-side JavaScript (`app.js`) is **not recommended** as it can be easily exposed. A more secure approach would be to proxy your API requests through a backend server.
- **CSS Minification & Optimization:** While the SCSS provides good organization, for production deployment, ensure that your `global.css` is minified and unused CSS is removed to improve performance.
- **Image Optimization:** Consider serving images in modern formats like WebP or AVIF for better performance.
- **Accessibility & Contrast:** While efforts have been made to improve accessibility (e.g., `aria-label`, `alt` text), thoroughly test the application with screen readers and ensure all color combinations meet WCAG contrast guidelines.
